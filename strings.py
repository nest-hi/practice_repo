print(name.split(" "))# - ['nestor', 'bora', 'orosco']
# The .split() method returns the string and separates it into chunks or array of strings
# in this case the .split() chopped our string into 3 because we have 2 spaces within the name string.

print(name.split(" ")[1]) # - "bora"
#we can specify which chunks we want to use by denoting the chunk's index

print(name.split(" ")[0].capitalize() , name.split(" ")[1].capitalize() , name.split(" ")[2].capitalize()) # - Nestor Bora Orosco

print(array_of_my_name[0]) # - n


#we can also create conditional statements with our string values.

print("n" in name) # - True
# this checks if the letter 'n' is inside the name string

# not in keyword is NEGATION, it checks if the 'n' exist in the string and inverts the boolean that it returns.
